# Scripts

This repo contains scripts from my bin directory, most of which I use.  Ones that I know I'm not using have been moved into xNOTUSED to try and keep things tidy.

## Install

Something like this will probably do the job:

	cd ~
	git clone git@github.com:/0x3F3f/Scripts.git bin

And add `bin` to your path, but you've probably done that already.

## List of Scripts

 I'm not going to maintain a complete list, but these are some of the more important ones I use:

	rsyncPi.sh     > Syncs (rsync) important folders on my machine with my raspberry pi using ssh
	rsyncUsb.sh    > Auto Mounts encrypted Truecrypt Partition, performs rsync,  then safely unmounts.
	screenshot.sh  > Was using this in i3 to quickly take a screenshot without using 3rd party progs.
    ytplay.sh      > Allows me to play Youtube vids via mpv, simply supply URL.
	volume.sh      > because "I can never remember the fucking command for this"
